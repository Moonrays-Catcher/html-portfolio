<h2>My top 3 movies you should watch.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
<p>This movie has intrigue, revenge, and moral choices.
    It is best enjoyed by envisioning the film as having a different storyline than the book.
</p>

<h3>2. The Sting</h3>
<p>Robert Redford and James Gandolfini are fantastic. One of the classic con movies of our time.</p>

<h3>3. The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Definitely dark and gritty. It's not for the faint of heart but Heath Ledger is phenomenal as the Joker.</p>
